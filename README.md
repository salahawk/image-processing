# Jpeg
This code is a full implementation for the JPEG image compression

The goal was to implement the basic jpeg image compression algorithm along with the developing metrics to monitor the data loss and compression efficiency. I was able to get off 50 % compression efficiency with almost .02% data loss between the raw and compressed image.
